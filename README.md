# Morse-code-decoder-and-encoder
Objective Morse code is one of the most recognized and used codes that was designed to secure (encrypt  and decrypt) the communication from the sender to its receiver. The main target we aim to achieve is to implement a message decipherer using the 8086 processor through the aid of 3 buttons, each  carrying out functioning roles. The first button represents a dot with length of one unit, second  button represents a dash consisting of three units and finally a third button which handles the spaces  between dots and dashes, to differentiate words from letters and different segments making up a  letter. After processing on the 8086 the result will be outputted on a display.
